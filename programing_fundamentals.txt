3 types of programming languages

1. Procedural Language 
	Series of well structured steps excuted one by one includes function 

2. Functional
	Series of functions
	Bundle a code in function to reuse it.
	Never modify variables. just operate on inocomming variables
	Situation - Opperations on same set of data. Simalar operations on similar signature of incoming data.
	Ex. Python, 

3. Object Oriented Programming
	Uses classes which is a named group of methods and properties.


Static Vs Dynamic languages
	
Static - 
	Define datatype when declaring variable at compile time
	Errors showup at compile time
	More control

Dynamic - 
	No need to define type when declaring variable
	Ex. Python


Memories

Stack  - 
	a = 10.
	here,
	- a is reference variable and 10 is object
	- variables are stored in stack and objects are stord in heap
	- a will point to address of the stored object

Garbage collection - 
	
	If objects does not have any reference variable pointing to it. It will be removed from the memory.
